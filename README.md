## Backtest from scratch
The ipython notebook containing the backtest will only work in the Quantopian research environment as it needs asset prices!

This is a vectorised backtest and optimisation that looks at a moving average crossover strategy. If run over a wide range 
of possible parameters it can be seen that it is actually profitable. 

Please play around with it and have fun!
